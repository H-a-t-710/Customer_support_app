      "Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected",
      "You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN",

IPO IPO OFS Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Stock SIP Where can I find my UPI ID? Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using. I don’t have a UPI ID. Can I apply for an IPO? In case you don’t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list. Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. How can I create my UPI ID? You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App Verify your mobile number Register the passcode (it is required to open the app) Select your bank from the options available The app will fetch your bank details In case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM Set up a UPI PIN for security Now you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. My daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack’s application will be rejected because Jill’s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack Jill’s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack’s PAN When will my funds be blocked and unblocked? Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO. Your funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO. Please reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. How can I get a guaranteed IPO allotment? We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment.

Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier? Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can't update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. What is DigiLocker? DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. What should I do if there's a name mismatch and I can't complete the step? For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. How can I add a new address as my current address? Use the “add” button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. What should I do if I can't change my permanent address? The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Can my permanent address be the same as my current address? Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Why is video KYC required? Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. What if I am not available during bank working hours? If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. When can I complete the Video KYC? Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. What if video KYC fails? You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. How will I know the status of my video KYC? Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the ‘My Investments’ tab. What should I do if I can't move to the next step and complete my KYC verification? Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn’t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. Why are details related to occupation, income, and family required for FD booking? These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Why is my money deducted before video KYC? Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment.

Orders आदेश एसआईपी निवेश मेरे ऑर्डर के लिए NAV क्या होगी? लागू एनएवी संबंधित एएमसी हाउस द्वारा फंड की वसूली पर आधारित है और कट-ऑफ से पहले बीएसई स्टार द्वारा सफल ऑर्डर प्रोसेसिंग के अधीन है। यहां 'धन की प्राप्ति' का मतलब है कि आपके ऑर्डर के लिए लागू एनएवी इस पर निर्भर करेगा कि फंड हाउस को पैसा प्राप्त हुआ है या नहीं। कृपया विभिन्न प्रकार के फंडों और ऑर्डरों के लिए कट-ऑफ समय का पता लगाएं आगे, शनिवार, रविवार और अन्य बाजार/सार्वजनिक छुट्टियों पर दिए गए ऑर्डर के लिए एनएवी प्रयोज्यता इस बात पर निर्भर करती है कि एक्सचेंज पर ऑर्डर कब दिए गए हैं। यह रहा the अगला व्यवसाय दिवस। UPI मोड के माध्यम से किए गए भुगतान का परिणाम आम तौर पर होता है एक ही दिन यदि ऑर्डर कट-ऑफ से पहले दिया गया है तो एनएवी। ऐसा इसलिए होता है क्योंकि ICCL का निपटान आमतौर पर UPI के माध्यम से किए जाने पर कट-ऑफ से पहले होता है। एंजेल वन आईसीसीएल निपटान के लिए भुगतान एग्रीगेटर पर निर्भर करता है। नेटबैंकिंग के माध्यम से किए गए भुगतान का परिणाम आम तौर पर अगले कार्य दिवस का एनएवी होता है। ऐसा इसलिए होता है क्योंकि ICCL का निपटान वास्तविक समय पर नहीं होता है और आम तौर पर 'T+1' आधार पर होता है। एंजेल वन आईसीसीएल निपटान के लिए भुगतान एग्रीगेटर पर निर्भर करता है। इसलिए भले ही ऑर्डर और भुगतान कट-ऑफ से पहले सफल हो, यदि भुगतान मोड नेटबैंकिंग है, तो इसका परिणाम अगले दिन का एनएवी हो सकता है। संक्षेप में, कुछ मामलों में, भले ही ऑर्डर और भुगतान कट-ऑफ से पहले होता है, एनएवी निर्भर करेगा आईसीसीएल को निपटान और एएमसी द्वारा धन की वसूली पर मैं अपना एसआईपी ऑर्डर नहीं देख पा रहा हूं जो मैंने हाल ही में दिया था? आपके ऑर्डर केवल तभी दिखाई देंगे जब आपने आज भुगतान किया हो। यदि आपने 'अभी पहला भुगतान करें' का चयन नहीं किया है। आपके एसआईपी केवल एसआईपी अनुभाग में दिखाई देंगे अपने सभी पंजीकृत एसआईपी देखने के लिए कृपया एसआईपी अनुभाग पर जाएं या नीचे दिए गए लिंक पर क्लिक करें: एसआईपी प्रबंधित करें मेरा निवेश मेरे पोर्टफोलियो में कब दिखाई देगा? जब आपका ऑर्डर आपके ऑर्डर टैब के 'पूर्ण' अनुभाग में चला जाएगा तो आपका निवेश आपके 'निवेश टैब' में दिखाई देगा। यह होता है जब हमें वह मिल जाता है e संबंधित एएमसी द्वारा यूनिट आवंटन की पुष्टि। इस प्रक्रिया में आम तौर पर ऑर्डर प्लेसमेंट तिथि से 3/4 कार्य दिवस लगते हैं। ऑर्डर टाइमलाइन में आपके पोर्टफोलियो अपडेट की तारीख हमारा अनुमान है कि एएमसी से यूनिट आवंटन की पुष्टि कब होगी। कृपया चिंता न करें, इस तारीख का आपकी एनएवी तारीख से कोई संबंध नहीं है। आपकी एनएवी तिथि एएमसी द्वारा धन की वसूली पर निर्भर करती है। यदि एसआईपी तिथि अभी तक नहीं आई है तो मेरा किस्त आदेश प्रगति पर क्यों है? हम आम तौर पर आपकी नियत तारीख से 2/3 कार्य दिवस पहले आपका एसआईपी किस्त आदेश बनाते हैं क्योंकि हमें यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए आपके ऑटो-पे लिंक्ड बैंक खाते के साथ पहले से समन्वय करना होता है कि आपकी एसआईपी किश्तें नियत तारीख पर सुचारू रूप से चलेंगी। ऑर्डर तिथि तब होती है जब हम अपने सिस्टम में आपका एसआईपी किस्त ऑर्डर बनाते हैं और एसआईपी देय तिथि वह होती है जब आपके ऑटोपे लिंक्ड बैंक खाते से पैसा डेबिट किया जाएगा। लागू एनएवी आमतौर पर आपके एसआईपी की देय तिथि का होता है। मेरे सक्रिय एसआईपी के लिए एसआईपी राशि मेरे बैंक खाते से कब डेबिट की जाएगी? आपका पैसा अपने आप तभी डेबिट हो जाएगा जब आपका एसआईपी ऑटोपे से जुड़ा होगा। यदि आपका एसआईपी ऑटोपे से जुड़ा हुआ है। एसआईपी राशि एसआईपी देय तिथि पर डेबिट हो जाएगी। क्या मेरा ऑर्डर सफल होगा? हमें आपके बैंक से सफल भुगतान की पुष्टि नहीं मिली है। हम यथाशीघ्र स्थिति अपडेट करेंगे. जब हमें भुगतान की पुष्टि और पुष्टि प्राप्त होगी तो आपके ऑर्डर की पुष्टि की जाएगी का एक्सचेंज द्वारा ऑर्डर प्लेसमेंट। यदि यह दोनों चरण सफलतापूर्वक पूरे हो जाते हैं। आपका आदेश सफल होगा. कृपया चिंता न करें, अगर हमें पुष्टिकरण नहीं मिलता है या भुगतान विफल हो जाता है। पूरी राशि 4-6 कार्य दिवसों में आपके स्रोत बैंक खाते से डेबिट कर दी जाएगी। यदि एसआईपी देय तिथि पर मेरे बैंक खाते में पर्याप्त शेष राशि नहीं है तो क्या होगा? यदि आप अपने ऑटोपे लिंक्ड बैंक खाते में पर्याप्त शेष राशि सुनिश्चित नहीं करते हैं तो आपकी एसआईपी किस्त विफल हो जाएगी। यदि आप एसआईपी देय तिथि पर अपने बैंक खाते में पर्याप्त शेष सुनिश्चित नहीं करते हैं तो आपका बैंक आपसे शुल्क भी ले सकता है। मेरे बैंक खाते से पैसे काट लिए गए लेकिन भुगतान स्थिति में भुगतान प्रगति पर है? हमें आपके बैंक खाते से सफल भुगतान की पुष्टि नहीं मिली है। हम यथाशीघ्र स्थिति अपडेट करेंगे. कृपया चिंता न करें, अगर हमें पुष्टिकरण नहीं मिलता है या भुगतान विफल हो जाता है। पूरी राशि 4-6 कार्य दिवसों में आपके स्रोत बैंक खाते से डेबिट कर दी जाएगी यदि पैसा डेबिट हो गया है लेकिन ऑर्डर विफल हो गया है तो रिफंड कब होगा? कृपया चिंता न करें, अगर हमें पुष्टिकरण नहीं मिलता है या भुगतान विफल हो जाता है। पूरी राशि 4-6 कार्य दिवसों में आपके स्रोत बैंक खाते से डेबिट कर दी जाएगी। मेरा पैसा डेबिट हो गया लेकिन लेनदेन विफल दिखा। रिफंड कब होगा? कृपया चिंता न करें, अगर हमें भुगतान की पुष्टि नहीं मिलती है या भुगतान/आदेश विफल हो जाता है। पूरी राशि 4-6 कार्य दिवसों में आपके स्रोत बैंक खाते से डेबिट कर दी जाएगी। यदि मेरा ऑर्डर विफल स्थिति में है तो क्या मेरा एसआईपी बनाया जाएगा? नहीं, आपका एसआईपी तभी बनाया जाएगा जब हमें आपके बैंक खाते से सफल भुगतान की पुष्टि मिलेगी। यदि भुगतान विफल हो जाता है, तो आपका एसआईपी भुगतान पंजीकृत नहीं किया जाएगा। मैंने जितने पैसे के लिए निकासी का आदेश दिया था, उससे कम पैसे मुझे मिले? एक्सचेंज पर ऑर्डर देते समय आपकी निकासी राशि को संबंधित इकाइयों में बदल दिया जाता है। हम वर्तमान एनएवी के आधार पर निकाली जाने वाली इकाइयों की गणना करते हैं। म्यूचुअल फंड एनएवी (नेट एसेट वैल्यू) को सोमवार से शुक्रवार (सभी कार्य दिवस) तक बाजार बंद होने के बाद हर दिन अपडेट किया जाता है। उदाहरण के लिए, 3 जून को, आप 2 जून का NAV देखेंगे। 3 जून को दिए गए निकासी आदेश के लिए निम्नलिखित परिदृश्य पर विचार करें: यदि 3 जून को एनएवी > 2 जून को, तो आपको ऑर्डर राशि से अधिक राशि प्राप्त होगी। यदि 3 जून को एनएवी <2 जून है, तो आपको ऑर्डर राशि से कम राशि प्राप्त होगी। सारांश में, आपको नवीनतम एनएवी के अनुसार राशि प्राप्त होगी। क्या मेरी अगली किस्त स्वतः डेबिट हो जाएगी? यदि आपके पास वैध ऑटो-पे सेटअप है तो आपकी अगली एसआईपी किस्त आपके बैंक खाते से ऑटो-डेबिट हो जाएगी। यदि नहीं, तो कृपया एक ऑटोपे सेटअप करें ताकि आपकी भविष्य की एसआईपी किस्तें स्वचालित हो सकें। ऑटोपे सेटअप करने के लिए कृपया नीचे क्लिक करें: {सेटअप ऑटोपे} स्टाम्प ड्यूटी क्या है? सरकार किसी भी म्यूचुअल फंड योजना की कुल खरीद राशि का 0.005% स्टांप शुल्क के रूप में एकत्र करती है। इसलिए भले ही आपके बैंक खाते से पूरी राशि डेबिट हो गई हो, कुल राशि का 0.005 प्रतिशत काट लिया जाता है और इसलिए जब ऑर्डर पूरा हो जाता है, तो वही राशि निवेशित राशि के रूप में दिखाई देती है। Still need help?

Trading & Surveillance व्यापार एवं निगरानी Risk Management – ASM & GSM निगरानी उपाय क्या है? बाजार निगरानी बाजारों की सुरक्षा और अखंडता सुनिश्चित करने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाती है क्योंकि यह प्रतिभूति बाजारों में अपमानजनक, चालाकीपूर्ण या अवैध व्यापार प्रथाओं की रोकथाम और जांच की प्रक्रिया है। निगरानी उपाय नियामक निकायों और एक्सचेंजों द्वारा मूल्य और अस्थिरता की निगरानी करके और अंदरूनी व्यापार, फर्जी लेनदेन और अधिक जैसी भ्रामक गतिविधियों का पता लगाकर व्यापारियों और निवेशकों की सुरक्षा के लिए एक पहल है। एएसएम क्या है? सेबी (भारतीय प्रतिभूति और विनिमय बोर्ड) ने स्टॉक एक्सचेंजों के साथ मिलकर निवेशकों के हितों की रक्षा के लिए एक अतिरिक्त निगरानी उपाय या एएसएम शुरू किया है ताकि यह सुनिश्चित किया जा सके कि अप्रत्याशित मूल्य आंदोलनों जैसी कोई बाजार अटकलें या हेरफेर न हों। एनएसई द्वारा निर्दिष्ट मानदंडों के आधार पर निगरानी के लिए शेयरों को एएसएम के तहत वर्गीकृत किया गया है here . जीएसएम क्या है? जीएसएम या ग्रेडेड सर्विलांस मेज़र एक प्रणाली है जिसका उपयोग एनएसई और बीएसई जैसे भारतीय स्टॉक एक्सचेंजों द्वारा व्यापारियों/निवेशकों को सचेत करने और उन्हें जीएसएम के तहत वर्गीकृत कुछ प्रतिभूतियों में लेनदेन करते समय अतिरिक्त सतर्क रहने के लिए कहने के लिए किया जाता है। असामान्य मूल्य वृद्धि के कारण शेयरों को जीएसएम के तहत वर्गीकृत किया जा सकता है जो कंपनी के वित्तीय स्वास्थ्य से मेल नहीं खाते हैं, तरल नहीं हैं, नगण्य बाजार पूंजी है, और कम प्रदर्शन कर रहे हैं। ASM और GSM में क्या अंतर है? एएसएम ढांचे का मुख्य उद्देश्य स्टॉक की अस्थिरता को नियंत्रित करना है, जबकि जीएसएम का प्राथमिक उद्देश्य निवेशकों को इंट्राडे ट्रेडिंग की अनुमति न देकर खराब प्रदर्शन करने वाले शेयरों से बचाना है और उन प्रतिभूतियों से निपटने के दौरान उन्हें अतिरिक्त सतर्क रहने की सलाह देना है जिनमें असामान्य मूल्य में उतार-चढ़ाव हो रहा है। . ये दोनों ढाँचे अलग-अलग उद्देश्यों के साथ पेश किए गए हैं, लेकिन इनका मुख्य लक्ष्य व्यापारियों और निवेशकों की सुरक्षा करना है। ASM के अंतर्गत किसी शेयर को वर्गीकृत करने का आधार क्या है? सेबी और एक्सचेंज संयुक्त रूप से निम्नलिखित मापदंडों के आधार पर एएसएम के तहत प्रतिभूतियों को शॉर्टलिस्ट करने के लिए उद्देश्य मानदंड तय करते हैं: 1. उच्च निम्न भिन्नता 2. ग्राहक एकाग्रता 3. मूल्य परिवर्तन के करीब-करीब 4. बाजार पूंजीकरण 5. आयतन भिन्नता 6. डिलिवरी प्रतिशत 7. अद्वितीय पैन और पीई की संख्या किसी शेयर को GSM के अंतर्गत कब वर्गीकृत किया जाएगा? नीचे दिए गए संकेतों के आधार पर, नियामक निकाय और एक्सचेंज जीएसएम श्रेणी के तहत एक शेयर जोड़ने का निर्णय लेते हैं: 1. इलिक्विड सिक्योरिटीज के लिए आवधिक कॉल नीलामी सत्र 2. व्यापार के लिए व्यापार से प्रतिभूतियों की आवाजाही की आवधिक समीक्षा 3. लगातार शोर पैदा करने वाले 4. कीमत/मात्रा में उछाल के मामले में अफवाह सत्यापन और स्पष्टीकरण कोई शेयर एएसएम/जीएसएम से कब निकलेगा? एएसएम के मामले में हर 2 महीने और जीएसएम के मामले में हर तिमाही में स्टॉक एक्सचेंज द्वारा की गई समीक्षा के आधार पर सूची से अंदर और बाहर जा सकता है। एएसएम के तहत निगरानी उपाय क्या हैं? कृपया एएसएम के अंतर्गत विस्तृत निगरानी उपाय देखें here .

A fixed deposit (FD) is a popular and safe investment option in India. You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations. Is it safe to invest in an FD? Yes, FDs are one of the safest investment options. Unlike market-led investments where returns fluctuate, the returns on an FD are fixed at the time of investment. Even if FD interest rates change over time, your FD will grow at the rate you initially booked. What is DICGC and which deposits are secured by them? The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It insures bank deposits, including savings, current, recurring, and fixed deposits, up to Rs. 5 lakh per account holder per bank. This insurance does not cover FDs with NBFCs. Can only banks offer fixed deposits? No, fixed deposits are offered by banks, NBFCs, and the India Post Office. FDs with NBFCs, known as Corporate FDs, often offer higher interest rates compared to banks. What is an NBFC and do they also offer fixed deposits? A Non-Banking Financial Corporation (NBFC) operates as a financial institution without a full banking license, regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Reserve Bank of India. NBFCs offer services like savings, investment plans, lending schemes, insurance, and fixed deposits. What is the minimum and maximum amount I can invest in a fixed deposit? You can start investing in fixed deposits with a minimum amount as low as INR 5000. The maximum amount varies based on the specific FD scheme you choose. Is it mandatory to add a nominee? No, it is not mandatory to add a nominee, but it is recommended. Can I add a nominee who is less than 18 years old? Yes, but you must provide the details of a guardian. Who can I add as a nominee? You can add any individual as a nominee, including family members, relatives, friends, or any trusted person. Can I add or change a nominee later? Yes, you can add or change a nominee later, but this service is currently available only with some partner banks. You will see the “Add Nominee” option on the dashboard once your FD is successfully booked. What is FD advice? FD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit. I do not file taxes. Is there a way for TDS to not get deducted from the FD? Currently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction. Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality. TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens. How are FDs taxed? Interest earnings from your fixed deposit are taxed according to your tax slab. For example, if you are in the 20% tax bracket and you earned Rs 6,000 interest from a 1-year FD of Rs 1 lakh at 6%, you will pay 20% of Rs 6,000, which is Rs 1,200, as tax. Still need help?

IPO IPO OFS Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) Stock SIP Where can I find my UPI ID? Generally, you can find your UPI ID in the profile section of the respective app you are using. I don’t have a UPI ID. Can I apply for an IPO? In case you don’t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list. Alternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. How can I create my UPI ID? You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App Verify your mobile number Register the passcode (it is required to open the app) Select your bank from the options available The app will fetch your bank details In case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM Set up a UPI PIN for security Now you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. Why am I unable to apply for IPOs via my UPI ID/Handle? For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed. In case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. Why can’t I see my UPI handle listed in the dropdown in the Angel One app while applying for an IPO? In case you can’t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO. Try to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. When will I receive my UPI mandate request after placing an order? Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App – Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not. In case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One’s Application OR Make sure your Payments App is updated. OR If it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one’s application and place a new bid. How to approve an IPO mandate request? You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. By when can I approve the UPI mandate request? Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. What are the charges of applying for an IPO? With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. How can an NRI apply for an IPO using the Angel One app? NRI’s can not apply via the Angel One app. However, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. What is the cut-off price & why should I apply at a cut-off price? Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors. This price is ascertained at the allotment stage. When an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price. In an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. Can I use a bank account not linked with Angel One to apply? You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. Can I apply for an IPO using my bank’s current account? It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account. You need to check with your bank for more details. Can I apply for an IPO using my HUF’s account? You cannot apply via the Angel One app. However, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. My daughter is a minor. Can I apply for an IPO using her account? The Angel One app doesn’t allow a minor to apply. Although, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. Why didn’t my account get debited after applying for an IPO? As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account. If the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date. Note: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds. If your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Can I modify my IPO bid? Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order. Please note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid. You will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid. However, if you haven’t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Why is my IPO application rejected? Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate Ensuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill’s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c.

IPO आईपीओ ओएफएस सॉवरेन गोल्ड बांड (एसजीबी) स्टॉक एसआईपी मुझे अपनी यूपीआई आईडी कहां मिल सकती है? आम तौर पर, आप अपनी यूपीआई आईडी उस संबंधित ऐप के प्रोफ़ाइल अनुभाग में पा सकते हैं जिसका आप उपयोग कर रहे हैं। मेरे पास UPI आईडी नहीं है. क्या मैं आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? यदि आपके पास यूपीआई आईडी नहीं है, तो आप इसे एनपीसीआई सूची में शामिल किसी भी यूपीआई हैंडल से बना सकते हैं। वैकल्पिक रूप से, आप अपने बैंक में एएसबीए के माध्यम से या भौतिक रूप से आवेदन कर सकते हैं। मैं अपनी UPI आईडी कैसे बना सकता हूँ? BHIM ऐप से UPI आईडी बनाने के लिए आप नीचे दिए गए चरणों का पालन कर सकते हैं Google Pay/ PhonePe/BHIM ऐप डाउनलोड करें अपना मोबाइल नंबर सत्यापित करें पासकोड रजिस्टर करें (ऐप खोलने के लिए यह आवश्यक है) उपलब्ध विकल्पों में से अपना बैंक चुनें ऐप आपके बैंक विवरण प्राप्त करेगा यदि आपके पास एक से अधिक खाते हैं, तो वह खाता चुनें जिसे आप BHIM के साथ पंजीकृत करना चाहते हैं सुरक्षा के लिए एक UPI पिन सेट करें अब आप प्रोफाइल सेक्शन में अपनी यूपीआई आईडी चेक कर सकते हैं। मैं अपनी यूपीआई आईडी/हैंडल के जरिए आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन क्यों नहीं कर पा रहा हूं? आईपीओ अनुप्रयोगों के लिए, केवल एनपीसीआई द्वारा अनुमोदित यूपीआई आईडी/हैंडल की अनुमति है। यदि आप अपनी यूपीआई आईडी/हैंडल का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने में असमर्थ हैं, तो हम अनुशंसा करते हैं कि आप आईपीओ आवेदन के लिए यूपीआई सेवा प्रदान करने के लिए एनपीसीआई द्वारा अनुमोदित बैंकों/ऐप की सूची की जांच करें। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करते समय मैं एंजेल वन ऐप में ड्रॉपडाउन में अपना यूपीआई हैंडल सूचीबद्ध क्यों नहीं देख सकता? यदि आप एंजेल वन ऐप में आईपीओ पेज पर ड्रॉपडाउन सूची में अपना यूपीआई हैंडल नहीं ढूंढ पाते हैं, तो इसका मतलब है कि आपका यूपीआई हैंडल आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए एनपीसीआई द्वारा अनुमोदित नहीं है। एनपीसीआई सूची में प्रदर्शित किसी भी इकाई के साथ वैकल्पिक यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग करने या बनाने का प्रयास करें। ऑर्डर देने के बाद मुझे अपना यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध कब प्राप्त होगा? नीचे कुछ चीज़ें दी गई हैं जो आप कर सकते हैं: अपने भुगतान ऐप पर जाएं - अधिदेश अनुभाग पर जाएं और जांचें कि आपके पास खुला अधिदेश है या नहीं। यदि आपको कई अधिदेश प्राप्त हुए हैं तो आप अधिदेश विवरण में उल्लिखित एप्लिकेशन आईडी को एंजेल वन के एप्लिकेशन से ऑर्डर विवरण में उल्लिखित एप्लिकेशन आईडी के साथ सत्यापित कर सकते हैं। या सुनिश्चित करें कि आपका भुगतान ऐप अपडेट है। या यदि 6 घंटे से अधिक समय लग रहा है तो एंजेल वन के आवेदन से अपनी बोली रद्द करें और नई बोली लगाएं। आईपीओ अधिदेश अनुरोध को कैसे स्वीकृत करें? आपको अपने यूपीआई ऐप में आईपीओ मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी देनी होगी। मैं UPI मैंडेट अनुरोध को कब तक स्वीकृत कर सकता हूँ? लंबित शासनादेश अंतिम दिन शाम 5 बजे के बाद समाप्त हो जाएंगे। इसलिए उपयोगकर्ताओं को आईपीओ में भाग लेने के लिए अंतिम दिन शाम 5 बजे से पहले जनादेश स्वीकार करना चाहिए। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने का शुल्क क्या है? एंजेल वन के साथ, आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए कोई शुल्क नहीं है। एंजेल वन ऐप का उपयोग करके एक एनआरआई आईपीओ के लिए कैसे आवेदन कर सकता है? एनआरआई एंजेल वन ऐप के माध्यम से आवेदन नहीं कर सकते हैं। हालाँकि, वे आपके बैंक में भौतिक एएसबीए (अवरुद्ध राशि द्वारा समर्थित एप्लिकेशन) प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से आवेदन कर सकते हैं। कट-ऑफ कीमत क्या है और मुझे कट-ऑफ कीमत पर आवेदन क्यों करना चाहिए? कट-ऑफ कीमत वह कीमत है जिस पर निवेशकों को आईपीओ के माध्यम से शेयर जारी किए जाते हैं। यह कीमत आवंटन चरण में सुनिश्चित की जाती है। जब कोई निवेशक कट-ऑफ कीमत पर आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करता है, तो इसका मतलब है कि वह इस कीमत पर बोली लगाने के लिए तैयार है। आदर्श परिदृश्य में, सभी खुदरा निवेशक अपने आवंटन की संभावना बढ़ाने के लिए कट-ऑफ कीमत पर बोली लगाते हैं। क्या मैं आवेदन करने के लिए ऐसे बैंक खाते का उपयोग कर सकता हूं जो एंजेल वन से लिंक नहीं है? आप किसी अन्य बैंक खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकते हैं, बशर्ते खाता निवेशक के नाम पर हो। क्या मैं अपने बैंक के चालू खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? यह बेहतर है कि आप अपने बचत खाते का उपयोग करके आवेदन करें क्योंकि अधिकांश बैंक चालू खाते का उपयोग करके जमा किए गए आईपीओ आवेदनों पर कार्रवाई नहीं करते हैं। अधिक जानकारी के लिए आपको अपने बैंक से जांच करनी होगी। क्या मैं अपने एचयूएफ खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूं? आप एंजेल वन ऐप के माध्यम से आवेदन नहीं कर सकते। हालाँकि, आप अपने बैंक में भौतिक एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से अपने एचयूएफ खाते का उपयोग करके आवेदन कर सकते हैं। मेरी बेटी नाबालिग है. क्या मैं उसके खाते का उपयोग करके आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन कर सकता हूँ? एंजेल वन ऐप किसी नाबालिग को आवेदन करने की अनुमति नहीं देता है। हालाँकि, एक नाबालिग आपके बैंक के माध्यम से भौतिक एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के माध्यम से आवेदन कर सकता है। आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के बाद मेरे खाते से डेबिट क्यों नहीं हुआ? एएसबीए प्रक्रिया के अनुसार, जब आप आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करते हैं तो बैंक आपके पैसे को रोक/रोक लेंगे। एक बार जब आपको शेयर आवंटित हो जाएंगे, तो राशि आपके बैंक खाते से काट ली जाएगी। यदि आपको शेयर आवंटित नहीं किए गए हैं, तो राशि यूपीआई जनादेश की समाप्ति तिथि पर/उससे पहले आपके खाते में अनब्लॉक/जारी कर दी जाएगी। ध्यान दें: बैंक आमतौर पर आपकी धनराशि जारी करने में 10-15 दिन का समय लेते हैं। यदि आपका धन 15 दिनों के बाद भी अवरुद्ध है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। क्या मैं अपनी आईपीओ बोली संशोधित कर सकता हूँ? हां, आप ऑर्डर देने के बाद अपनी आईपीओ बोली के लॉट साइज और यूपीआई आईडी को संशोधित कर सकते हैं। कृपया ध्यान दें कि यदि आपने ऑर्डर के लिए अपने यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी दे दी है और बाद में ऑर्डर को संशोधित किया है, तो आपकी मूल आईपीओ बोली के लिए अवरुद्ध राशि के अलावा पूरी आईपीओ बोली राशि अवरुद्ध कर दी जाएगी। आपको अपनी संशोधित बोली के लिए एक और UPI मैंडेट अनुरोध भी प्राप्त होगा। हालाँकि, यदि आपने मूल अधिदेश अनुरोध को मंजूरी नहीं दी है, तो मूल आईपीओ बोली के लिए कोई भी राशि अवरुद्ध नहीं की जाएगी। मेरा आईपीओ आवेदन क्यों खारिज कर दिया गया है? आपके आईपीओ आवेदन खारिज होने के कुछ सामान्य कारण हो सकता है कि आपने अधिदेश स्वीकृत करते समय गलत UPI आईडी या UPI पिन दर्ज कर दिया हो यह सुनिश्चित करना कि बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता और यूपीआई आईडी एक ही पैन पर मैप किए गए हैं उदाहरण के लिए: जैक अपने डीमैट खाते से आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए जिल की यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग कर रहा है। ऐसे में जैक का आवेदन इसलिए खारिज कर दिया जायेगा जिल का इस्तेमाल किया गया बैंक खाता जैक के डीमैट खाते से जुड़ा नहीं है जिल की इस्तेमाल की गई यूपीआई आईडी जैक के पैन से जुड़ी नहीं है मेरे फंड कब ब्लॉक और अनब्लॉक होंगे? आईपीओ के लिए यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध को मंजूरी मिलते ही आपका फंड ब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। यदि आईपीओ के माध्यम से शेयर आवंटित नहीं किए जाते हैं तो आपका फंड यूपीआई जनादेश की समाप्ति तिथि पर या उससे पहले अनब्लॉक/रिलीज़ कर दिया जाएगा। यदि आदेश की समाप्ति तिथि के बाद धनराशि अनब्लॉक/रिलीज़ नहीं होती है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। मैं गारंटीकृत आईपीओ आवंटन कैसे प्राप्त कर सकता हूं? हम यह समझाना चाहेंगे कि एंजेल वन केवल आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने का एक मंच है और इसके आवंटन पर इसका कोई नियंत्रण नहीं है। आईपीओ आवंटन की कभी भी गारंटी नहीं दी जा सकती, क्योंकि अधिक अभिदान की स्थिति में आवंटन लॉटरी प्रणाली के माध्यम से किया जाता है। हालाँकि, आप आवेदन अस्वीकृति से बच सकते हैं प्रति पैन केवल 1 डीमैट खाते से आवेदन करना कट-ऑफ मूल्य पर आवेदन करना यह सुनिश्चित करना कि बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता और यूपीआई आईडी एक ही पैन पर मैप किए गए हैं उदाहरण के लिए: जैक अपने डीमैट खाते से आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करने के लिए जिल की यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग कर रहा है। ऐसे में जैक का आवेदन इसलिए खारिज कर दिया जायेगा जिल का उपयोग किया गया बैंक ए/सी जैक के डीमैट खाते से लिंक नहीं है जिल की इस्तेमाल की गई यूपीआई आईडी जैक के पैन से जुड़ी नहीं है अस्वीकृत/गैर-आवंटित आईपीओ आवेदन के मामले में मैं अपनी रिफंड स्थिति कहां देख सकता हूं? जब आप आईपीओ के लिए आवेदन करेंगे तो बैंक आपके पैसे को रोक लेंगे/अवरुद्ध कर देंगे। तो, आपका फंड UPI मैंडेट की समाप्ति तिथि पर या उससे पहले जारी/अनब्लॉक कर दिया जाएगा। यदि उल्लिखित तिथि के बाद धनराशि अनब्लॉक या जारी नहीं की जाती है तो कृपया अपने बैंक से संपर्क करें। मुझे अपना आईपीओ आवंटन क्यों नहीं मिला? आपको आवंटन न मिलने के सामान्य कारण ये हैं गैर-आबंटन - अधिक अभिदान के कारण आवंटन लॉटरी प्रणाली के माध्यम से किया जाता है अस्वीकृति - निम्नलिखित में से किसी भी कारण से आवेदन अस्वीकार किया जा सकता है: 1) एक ही पैन वाले कई डीमैट खातों से प्राप्त आवेदन 2) बैंक खाता, डीमैट खाता, और यूपीआई आईडी का उपयोग ऐसे एप्लिकेशन के लिए किया जाता है जो समान पैन से मैप नहीं किया गया हो 3) आपकी बोली मूल्य अंतिम निर्गम मूल्य से कम है क्या आईपीओ से लाभ पर कर लागू होता है? आपके कर दायरे के अनुसार आपके लाभ पर कर लगाया जाएगा। अगला आईपीओ कब आ रहा है? आगामी आईपीओ के बारे में सभी जानकारी प्राप्त करने के लिए हमारी वेबसाइट https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-आईपीओ पर जाएं। मैंने अधिदेश अनुरोध को मंजूरी दे दी है, लेकिन एंजेल वन ऐप पर स्थिति अभी भी लंबित है। क्या करें? एंजेल वन ऐप पर आपकी यूपीआई मैंडेट अनुरोध स्थिति वास्तविक समय में अपडेट नहीं होती है। यह शीघ्र ही आपके आईपीओ ऑर्डर बुक में दिखाई देगा। क्या मैं अपनी आईपीओ बोली वापस ले/हटा/रद्द कर सकता हूँ? एंजेल वन ऐप में आईपीओ आवेदन प्रक्रिया के लिए, आवेदन वापस लेना, हटाना और रद्द करना एक ही बात है। अपना आईपीओ आवेदन वापस लेने/रद्द करने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसे आप रद्द करना चाहते हैं अपना आईपीओ ऑर्डर रद्द करने के लिए रद्द करें और पुष्टि करें पर टैप करें मैं अपने आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति कैसे जांच सकता हूं? अपने आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति जांचने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसके लिए आप आवेदन की स्थिति जांचना चाहते हैं यहां से आपके आईपीओ आवेदन की स्थिति दिखाई देगी आईपीओ आवंटन स्थिति की जांच कहां करें? अपनी सदस्यता स्थिति जांचने के लिए नीचे दिए गए पथ का अनुसरण करें होम पेज पर आईपीओ पर टैप करें आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और उस आईपीओ ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें जिसके लिए आप सदस्यता स्थिति की जांच करना चाहते हैं आपकी आईपीओ सदस्यता स्थिति यहां दिखाई देगी क्या मैं आईपीओ के लिए एकाधिक आवेदन जमा कर सकता हूँ? प्रति पैन केवल 1 आवेदन की अनुशंसा की जाती है। यदि आप एक ही पैन का उपयोग करके विभिन्न प्लेटफार्मों के माध्यम से आवेदन करते हैं, तो भी आपका आवेदन खारिज कर दिया जाएगा और आपको आईपीओ आवंटन नहीं मिलेगा। हालाँकि, आप अलग-अलग पैन से जुड़े अलग-अलग खाते के साथ आवेदन करके आईपीओ आवंटन की संभावना बढ़ा सकते हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, आप अपने और अपने माता-पिता के डीमैट खाते से अलग-अलग आवेदन कर सकते हैं। Still need help?

A fixed transaction fee of ₹20 + GST is charged for each pledge and unpledge request, regardless of the number of shares. The split is as follows. INR 5 (Depository) + INR 15 (Angel One Charge) + GST उदाहरण के लिए, Suppose you want to pledge 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and 50 shares of XYZ Ltd. You will be charged ₹40 + GST for 2 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request. Similarly, if you want to place one unpledge request for 100 shares of ABC Ltd. and two unpledge requests for 50 shares and 20 shares of XYZ Ltd, respectively. In this case, you will be charged (₹20 x 3) = ₹60 + GST for 3 requests, irrespective of the number of shares in each request. Still need help? Create Ticket Want to connect with us?

A fixed deposit (FD) is a popular and safe investment option in India. You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations. Is it safe to invest in an FD?

The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). It insures bank deposits, including savings, current, recurring, and fixed deposits, up to Rs. 5 lakh per account holder per bank. This insurance does not cover FDs with NBFCs. Can only banks offer fixed deposits? No, fixed deposits are offered by banks, NBFCs, and the India Post Office. FDs with NBFCs, known as Corporate FDs, often offer higher interest rates compared to banks. What is an NBFC and do they also offer fixed deposits? A Non-Banking Financial Corporation (NBFC) operates as a financial institution without a full banking license, regulated by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and the Reserve Bank of India. NBFCs offer services like savings, investment plans, lending schemes, insurance, and fixed deposits. What is the minimum and maximum amount I can invest in a fixed deposit? You can start investing in fixed deposits with a minimum amount as low as INR 5000. The maximum amount varies based on the specific FD scheme you choose. Is it mandatory to add a nominee? No, it is not mandatory to add a nominee, but it is recommended. Can I add a nominee who is less than 18 years old? Yes, but you must provide the details of a guardian. Who can I add as a nominee? You can add any individual as a nominee, including family members, relatives, friends, or any trusted person. Can I add or change a nominee later? Yes, you can add or change a nominee later, but this service is currently available only with some partner banks. You will see the “Add Nominee” option on the dashboard once your FD is successfully booked. What is FD advice? FD advice is a computer-generated statement provided by the bank as proof of ownership or investment when you open a fixed deposit. I do not file taxes. Is there a way for TDS to not get deducted from the FD? Currently, we do not offer a solution to avoid TDS deduction. Some banks allow the filing of forms 15G/15H, but we do not have this functionality. TDS is deducted only if the total interest from all sources with the bank exceeds Rs 40,000 for normal citizens and Rs 50,000 for senior citizens. How are FDs taxed?

The repayment schedule is not available on the app. You can request your repayment schedule by: Emailing at: support@creditsaison-in.com Calling: 18001038961 What happens if I miss an EMI? Will ECS bounce charges be levied? Yes, if you miss an EMI, a bounce charge of INR 450 will be applied. Do I get email/SMS reminders from the Banks before my EMI date? Lenders will send EMI reminders before the due date via call and WhatsApp. Do I have the option of part prepayment of the loan? Are there any charges for it? No, part prepayment of the loan is not available currently. How do I check my payment statement online? You can check your payment statement online under the ‘Loans’ tab. All details for verification, tracking, and managing your loans will be available there once the loan is approved. What happens if I don't pay back OR miss EMI repayments on the Loan? If you miss or fail to repay your EMIs on the loan, it can negatively affect your credit score and may lead to additional charges or legal action. We strongly urge you to avoid missing your loan monthly installment payments. How can I pay my missed EMI or foreclose the loan? If your EMI is not cleared from your bank account via the auto debit E-NACH mandate on the due date due to inadvertent circumstances, you can pay it yourself through the Angel One app. Follow these steps: Open the Angel One app. Navigate to the loan pass book. Use the “Pay Now” section to make the payment via net banking or debit card. Alternatively, the EMI mandate will be represented for auto debit from your bank account. To foreclose the loan, you can also use the Angel One app to find the option to foreclose and complete the payment using the same methods. How can I change my bank account used for repaying the EMI? Presently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement. When can I foreclose my loan? Your eligibility for foreclosure varies depending on the lender partner. Please check your loan documents for specific details regarding foreclosure eligibility and conditions. Still need help?

      "इसके पीछे 2 प्रमुख कारण हो सकते हैं:",
      "टिप्पणी: निष्पादन की संभावना बढ़ाने के लिए, हम सीमा मूल्य के डिफ़ॉल्ट मान को ट्रिगर मूल्य से 2 टिक दूर रखते हैं। ऐसा इसलिए किया जाता है ताकि यदि एलटीपी ऑर्डर को ट्रिगर करने के बाद तेजी से आगे बढ़ता है, तो सीमा मूल्य बाधा नहीं होनी चाहिए और ऑर्डर अभी भी निष्पादित होना चाहिए। इसके अलावा, यदि आप पूर्व-निर्धारित सीमा मूल्य को बदलते हैं और इसे ट्रिगर मूल्य के करीब लाते हैं, तो अस्थिरता के मामलों में निष्पादन की संभावना कम हो सकती है।",
      "संभावना यह है कि बाज़ार मूल्य ने स्टॉप-लॉस मूल्य को प्रभावित किया हो, भले ही क्षण भर के लिए और उस समय आप इसे पहचान न सकें। एक सेकंड के भीतर, कीमतें कई बार बदल सकती हैं और उन सभी को एक्सचेंज द्वारा ब्रोकरों को रिले नहीं किया जाता है, खासकर उच्च अस्थिरता के दौरान। परिणामस्वरूप, कीमतों में इस तरह का क्षणिक उतार-चढ़ाव कहीं देखने को नहीं मिलता है। मूल्य मिलान और ऑर्डर का निष्पादन एक्सचेंजों द्वारा किया जाता है, ब्रोकर द्वारा नहीं।",
      "स्टॉप-लॉस एक उपकरण है जिसका उपयोग निवेशक किसी व्यापार में नुकसान को कम करने के लिए करते हैं। कुछ व्यापारी इसे अग्रिम आदेश के रूप में परिभाषित करते हैं, जो स्टॉक मूल्य ट्रिगर मूल्य स्तर तक पहुंचने पर खुली स्थिति को स्वचालित रूप से बंद कर देता है।\nस्टॉप लॉस नुकसान को कम करने में मदद करता है लेकिन व्यापार से मुनाफे को भी सीमित करता है।",
      "ट्रेलिंग स्टॉप-लॉस एक ऐसा ऑर्डर है जो आपको किसी व्यापार में होने वाले नुकसान का अधिकतम मूल्य या प्रतिशत निर्धारित करने देता है। यदि प्रतिभूति मूल्य आपके पक्ष में बढ़ता या गिरता है, तो ट्रिगर मूल्य निर्धारित मूल्य या प्रतिशत पर इसके साथ बढ़ जाता है। यदि सुरक्षा मूल्य आपके विरुद्ध बढ़ता या घटता है, तो ऑर्डर की प्रकृति के आधार पर ट्रिगर मूल्य यथावत रहता है।",
      "बाजार की अस्थिर स्थिति के दौरान स्टॉप-लॉस आपका वास्तविक रक्षक हो सकता है। व्यापार की शुरुआत में निर्धारित मूल्य स्तर व्यापारियों को स्टॉप-लॉस तक पहुंचने पर स्वचालित रूप से अपनी स्थिति बंद करने की अनुमति देता है। ट्रिगर मूल्य स्तर पर उपलब्ध अगले मूल्य पर स्क्वेरिंग ऑफ होता है और नुकसान को सीमित करने में मदद मिलती है।",
      "1% नियम किसी व्यापार या जोखिम-प्रति-व्यापार में उठाए जा सकने वाले जोखिम की अधिकतम सीमा को परिभाषित करता है। इसका तात्पर्य आपकी स्थिति को समायोजित करना है ताकि स्टॉप-लॉस ट्रिगर होने पर कुल हानि आपके व्यापार मूल्य के 1% से अधिक न हो। 1% नियम महत्वपूर्ण नुकसान से बचने में मदद करता है।",

Stop loss order ध्यानसूची टोकरी आदेश आदेश की स्थिति हुकूम देना रोबो ऑर्डर बंद वर्ग हानि रोकने का आदेश ऑर्डर के प्रकार सीमा आदेश मार्जिन कैलकुलेटर विकल्प आदेश अस्वीकृति जब मैं अपनी स्थिति से बाहर निकलने या स्टॉप-लॉस ऑर्डर देने की कोशिश कर रहा हूं, तो इसे अस्वीकार क्यों किया जा रहा है? ऐसा तब हो सकता है जब आपके पास स्टॉप-लॉस (एसएल) या एक्जिट ऑर्डर पहले से ही लंबित हो। पहले से ही लंबित स्टॉप-लॉस या एग्जिट ऑर्डर के साथ, आपको डुप्लिकेट एसएल/एग्जिट ऑर्डर देने में सक्षम होने के लिए अतिरिक्त धन की आवश्यकता होगी। यदि आपके खाते में यह अतिरिक्त धनराशि नहीं है, तो आपका डुप्लिकेट निकास आदेश अस्वीकार कर दिया जाएगा। इसीलिए हम बाहर निकलते समय आपको सूचित करते हैं कि क्या किसी स्थिति के विरुद्ध कोई एसएल/निकास आदेश लंबित है, ताकि किसी भी डुप्लिकेट ऑर्डर और अस्वीकृति से बचा जा सके। मेरा स्टॉप-लॉस (एसएल) ऑर्डर चालू हो गया था लेकिन यह निष्पादित नहीं हुआ। ऐसा क्यों हुआ? इसके पीछे 2 प्रमुख कारण हो सकते हैं: बाजार की गहराई में कमी के कारण परिसंपत्ति को परिभाषित स्टॉप-लॉस सीमा मूल्य पर खरीदार/विक्रेता की कमी हो सकती है। ऑर्डर ख़रीदे या बेचे जाते समय कतारबद्ध होते हैं। एक। उदाहरण के लिए: मान लीजिए कि 50 खरीदार और 100 विक्रेता हैं जो ₹90 पर एक शेयर पर व्यापार करने की प्रतीक्षा कर रहे हैं। ₹90 तक पहुंचने पर, पहले 50 विक्रेताओं के ऑर्डर निष्पादित किए जाएंगे, और शेष 50 विक्रेताओं को नए खरीदारों के लिए इंतजार करना होगा। यदि आप उन शेष 50 विक्रेताओं में से एक हैं, तो आपका बेचने का आदेश यदि कोई संबंधित खरीदार नहीं है तो यह लंबित रहेगा और इसके विपरीत भी। उच्च अस्थिरता के दौरान कीमत में उतार-चढ़ाव कुछ मानदंडों को पूरा नहीं करता है, उदाहरण के लिए मान लीजिए कि आपने एक रखा है स्टॉप-लॉस बेचें ट्रिगर मूल्य के साथ ₹100 और कीमत ₹100 पर सीमित करें। अब कल्पना करें कि एलटीपी ₹100 को छू गया (यहां, एसएल ट्रिगर हो जाएगा) और उच्च अस्थिरता के कारण जल्दी ही ₹100 से नीचे चला गया। ₹100 की सीमा कीमत का मतलब है कि स्टॉप-लॉस ऑर्डर केवल ₹100 या अधिक पर निष्पादित होगा। अब यह ऑर्डर लंबित रहेगा क्योंकि कीमत 100 रुपये से कम है और निष्पादन तभी होगा जब कीमत 100 रुपये तक पहुंच जाएगी या पार कर जाएगी। इसलिए आपका स्टॉप-लॉस ऑर्डर निष्पादित नहीं किया गया था। इस कारण से, हम उच्च अस्थिरता के दौरान स्टॉप लॉस निष्पादन की संभावना बढ़ाने के लिए ट्रिगर मूल्य और सीमा मूल्य के बीच पर्याप्त अंतर रखने की सलाह देते हैं। टिप्पणी: निष्पादन की संभावना बढ़ाने के लिए, हम सीमा मूल्य के डिफ़ॉल्ट मान को ट्रिगर मूल्य से 2 टिक दूर रखते हैं। ऐसा इसलिए किया जाता है ताकि यदि एलटीपी ऑर्डर को ट्रिगर करने के बाद तेजी से आगे बढ़ता है, तो सीमा मूल्य बाधा नहीं होनी चाहिए और ऑर्डर अभी भी निष्पादित होना चाहिए। इसके अलावा, यदि आप पूर्व-निर्धारित सीमा मूल्य को बदलते हैं और इसे ट्रिगर मूल्य के करीब लाते हैं, तो अस्थिरता के मामलों में निष्पादन की संभावना कम हो सकती है। मेरा स्टॉप-लॉस ऑर्डर ट्रिगर हो गया, भले ही पूर्वनिर्धारित ट्रिगर मूल्य सामने नहीं आया था। क्यों? संभावना यह है कि बाज़ार मूल्य ने स्टॉप-लॉस मूल्य को प्रभावित किया हो, भले ही क्षण भर के लिए और उस समय आप इसे पहचान न सकें। एक सेकंड के भीतर, कीमतें कई बार बदल सकती हैं और उन सभी को एक्सचेंज द्वारा ब्रोकरों को रिले नहीं किया जाता है, खासकर उच्च अस्थिरता के दौरान। परिणामस्वरूप, कीमतों में इस तरह का क्षणिक उतार-चढ़ाव कहीं देखने को नहीं मिलता है। मूल्य मिलान और ऑर्डर का निष्पादन एक्सचेंजों द्वारा किया जाता है, ब्रोकर द्वारा नहीं। स्टॉप लॉस क्या है? स्टॉप-लॉस एक उपकरण है जिसका उपयोग निवेशक किसी व्यापार में नुकसान को कम करने के लिए करते हैं। कुछ व्यापारी इसे अग्रिम आदेश के रूप में परिभाषित करते हैं, जो स्टॉक मूल्य ट्रिगर मूल्य स्तर तक पहुंचने पर खुली स्थिति को स्वचालित रूप से बंद कर देता है। स्टॉप लॉस नुकसान को कम करने में मदद करता है लेकिन व्यापार से मुनाफे को भी सीमित करता है। ट्रेलिंग स्टॉप लॉस क्या है? ट्रेलिंग स्टॉप-लॉस एक ऐसा ऑर्डर है जो आपको किसी व्यापार में होने वाले नुकसान का अधिकतम मूल्य या प्रतिशत निर्धारित करने देता है। यदि प्रतिभूति मूल्य आपके पक्ष में बढ़ता या गिरता है, तो ट्रिगर मूल्य निर्धारित मूल्य या प्रतिशत पर इसके साथ बढ़ जाता है। यदि सुरक्षा मूल्य आपके विरुद्ध बढ़ता या घटता है, तो ऑर्डर की प्रकृति के आधार पर ट्रिगर मूल्य यथावत रहता है। स्टॉप-लॉस कैसे ट्रिगर होता है? बाजार की अस्थिर स्थिति के दौरान स्टॉप-लॉस आपका वास्तविक रक्षक हो सकता है। व्यापार की शुरुआत में निर्धारित मूल्य स्तर व्यापारियों को स्टॉप-लॉस तक पहुंचने पर स्वचालित रूप से अपनी स्थिति बंद करने की अनुमति देता है। ट्रिगर मूल्य स्तर पर उपलब्ध अगले मूल्य पर स्क्वेरिंग ऑफ होता है और नुकसान को सीमित करने में मदद मिलती है। ट्रेडिंग का 1% नियम क्या है? 1% नियम किसी व्यापार या जोखिम-प्रति-व्यापार में उठाए जा सकने वाले जोखिम की अधिकतम सीमा को परिभाषित करता है। इसका तात्पर्य आपकी स्थिति को समायोजित करना है ताकि स्टॉप-लॉस ट्रिगर होने पर कुल हानि आपके व्यापार मूल्य के 1% से अधिक न हो। 1% नियम महत्वपूर्ण नुकसान से बचने में मदद करता है। क्या मैं एंजेलवन ट्रेडिंग ऐप के साथ ट्रेडिंग में स्टॉप-लॉस का उपयोग कर सकता हूं? आप नीचे दिए गए सरल चरणों का पालन करके एंजेलवन मोबाइल ऐप में स्टॉप लॉस ऑर्डर दे सकते हैं: एंजेलवन ऐप पर जाएं और खरीदने/बेचने के लिए स्टॉक का चयन करें व्यापार की मात्रा चुनें 'ट्रिगर मूल्य' सेट करें वह मूल्य दर्ज करें जहां आप स्टॉप-लॉस लगाना चाहते हैं स्टॉप-लॉस मूल्य की पुष्टि करें, \"खरीदें/बेचें\" पर क्लिक करें और ऑर्डर की पुष्टि करें Still need help?

      "तत्काल या रद्द (आईओसी) ऑर्डर के मामले में, ऑर्डर को बाजार में जारी होते ही निष्पादित करना होगा। इसका मतलब है कि सुरक्षा की खरीद या बिक्री लगभग तुरंत हो जाती है, और यदि ऐसा नहीं होता है, तो ऑर्डर स्वचालित रूप से रद्द हो जाता है।",

      "ऐसा तब हो सकता है जब आपने मौजूदा बाजार मूल्य से कम कीमत पर बेचने की कोशिश की हो या मौजूदा कीमत से अधिक कीमत पर खरीदने की कोशिश की हो। ऐसी स्थिति में सिस्टम इसे मार्केट ऑर्डर मानता है और मौजूदा कीमत पर निष्पादित करता है।",
      "एक सेकंड में कई दाम मिल जाते हैं. एप्लिकेशन पर सभी मूल्य परिवर्तन नहीं दिखाए गए हैं। यह संभव है कि कीमत का उल्लंघन किया गया हो लेकिन आवेदन पर नहीं दिखाया जा सका हो। ऐसा हो सकता है क्योंकि आप प्रति सेकंड केवल एक टिक देख पाते हैं, जब स्टॉप-लॉस सीमा का उल्लंघन होता है और व्यापार निष्पादित होता है तो आप कीमत नहीं देख पाएंगे।",

Types of Orders ध्यानसूची टोकरी आदेश आदेश की स्थिति हुकूम देना रोबो ऑर्डर बंद वर्ग हानि रोकने का आदेश ऑर्डर के प्रकार सीमा आदेश मार्जिन कैलकुलेटर विकल्प आदेश अस्वीकृति लिमिट और मार्केट ऑर्डर के बीच क्या अंतर है? एक सीमा आदेश में खरीद मूल्य या बिक्री मूल्य निर्दिष्ट किया जाता है और व्यापार तभी निष्पादित किया जाता है जब कीमत पूरी हो जाती है। इसके विपरीत, एक मार्केट ऑर्डर मौजूदा बाजार मूल्य पर निष्पादित होता है। तत्काल या रद्द (आईओसी) आदेश क्या है? तत्काल या रद्द (आईओसी) ऑर्डर के मामले में, ऑर्डर को बाजार में जारी होते ही निष्पादित करना होगा। इसका मतलब है कि सुरक्षा की खरीद या बिक्री लगभग तुरंत हो जाती है, और यदि ऐसा नहीं होता है, तो ऑर्डर स्वचालित रूप से रद्द हो जाता है। मैं जीटीटी ऑर्डर कैसे दूं? उस शेयर पर टैप करें जिसके लिए आप जीटीटी ऑर्डर देना चाहते हैं खरीदें/बेचें पर क्लिक करें और \"डिलीवरी\" चुनें स्मार्ट ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें और जीटीटी ऑर्डर पर क्लिक करें ट्रिगर मूल्य, सीमा मूल्य दर्ज करें और \"जीटीटी बनाएं\" पर क्लिक करें स्टॉप लॉस ऑर्डर क्या हैं? स्टॉप-लॉस ऑर्डर एक खरीद/बिक्री ऑर्डर है जो आपके व्यापार के विरुद्ध कीमतें बढ़ने की स्थिति में आपके नुकसान को सीमित करने में आपकी सहायता कर सकता है। अगर आप कोई स्टॉक खरीद रहे हैं तो आपको सेल स्टॉप-लॉस जोड़ना होगा। अगर आपको कोई स्टॉक बेचना है तो आपको बाय स्टॉप-लॉस जोड़ना होगा। गुड टिल ट्रिगर ऑर्डर (जीटीटी) क्या है? जीटीटी ऑर्डर आपको पूर्व निर्धारित मूल्य पर खरीदने या बेचने का ऑर्डर देने की अनुमति देता है। यदि जीटीटी ऑर्डर समाप्त होने से पहले स्टॉक का बाजार मूल्य आपके निर्दिष्ट मूल्य, जिसे ट्रिगर मूल्य भी कहा जाता है, तक पहुंच जाता है तो ये ऑर्डर निष्पादित किए जाते हैं। जीटीटी ऑर्डर एक वर्ष के लिए वैध हैं। यदि एक वर्ष के भीतर कीमत नहीं मिलती है तो ऑर्डर रद्द कर दिया जाता है जीटीटी ऑर्डर की वैधता क्या है? जीटीटी ऑर्डर एक ऐसी सुविधा है जो आपको 1 वर्ष के ऑर्डर की समाप्ति तिथि के साथ अपनी वांछित कीमत पर शेयर खरीदने/बेचने की अनुमति देती है। क्या मैं जीटीटी का उपयोग करके इंट्राडे ऑर्डर दे सकता हूं? जीटीटी सुविधा का उपयोग इंट्राडे के लिए नहीं किया जा सकता। जीटीटी ऑर्डर का उपयोग किन सेगमेंट के लिए किया जा सकता है? जीटीटी ऑर्डर का उपयोग डिलीवरी मार्जिन उत्पाद प्रकार के तहत इक्विटी कैश सेगमेंट के लिए किया जा सकता है एनएसई, एमसीएक्स एनसीडीईएक्स डेरिवेटिव जीटीटी ऑर्डर कैरी फॉरवर्ड उत्पाद प्रकार के तहत रखे जा सकते हैं। मेरा लिमिट ऑर्डर बाज़ार मूल्य पर निष्पादित क्यों किया गया? ऐसा तब हो सकता है जब आपने मौजूदा बाजार मूल्य से कम कीमत पर बेचने की कोशिश की हो या मौजूदा कीमत से अधिक कीमत पर खरीदने की कोशिश की हो। ऐसी स्थिति में सिस्टम इसे मार्केट ऑर्डर मानता है और मौजूदा कीमत पर निष्पादित करता है। मेरा स्टॉप लॉस ऑर्डर क्यों निष्पादित किया गया, भले ही कीमत ने मेरे ट्रिगर का उल्लंघन नहीं किया हो? एक सेकंड में कई दाम मिल जाते हैं. एप्लिकेशन पर सभी मूल्य परिवर्तन नहीं दिखाए गए हैं। यह संभव है कि कीमत का उल्लंघन किया गया हो लेकिन आवेदन पर नहीं दिखाया जा सका हो। ऐसा हो सकता है क्योंकि आप प्रति सेकंड केवल एक टिक देख पाते हैं, जब स्टॉप-लॉस सीमा का उल्लंघन होता है और व्यापार निष्पादित होता है तो आप कीमत नहीं देख पाएंगे। प्री-ओपन सत्र में मेरा बाज़ार ऑर्डर एक सीमा ऑर्डर क्यों बन गया? प्री-ओपन सत्र में, सभी बेजोड़ बाजार ऑर्डर को उनके मूल टाइमस्टैम्प के साथ संतुलन मूल्य पर सीमा ऑर्डर के रूप में सामान्य बाजार में ले जाया जाता है। यदि शुरुआती कीमत की खोज नहीं की गई है, तो बाजार ऑर्डर पिछले दिन के समापन मूल्य पर ले जाया जाएगा तत्काल या रद्द आदेश (आईओसी) आदेश क्या है? तत्काल या रद्द किए गए ऑर्डर के मामले में, ऑर्डर को बाज़ार में जारी होते ही निष्पादित करना होगा। इसका मतलब है कि सुरक्षा की खरीद या बिक्री लगभग तुरंत हो जाती है और यदि ऐसा नहीं होता है, तो ऑर्डर स्वचालित रूप से रद्द हो जाता है। डिलिवरी ऑर्डर क्या है? डिलीवरी ऑर्डर का मतलब है कि आप कुछ शेयर खरीदते हैं, और उन्हें अपने डीमैट खाते में रखते हैं। आप जब तक चाहें इन्हें अपने डीमैट खाते में रख सकते हैं। डिलीवरी ऑर्डर का उपयोग दीर्घकालिक निवेश के लिए किया जाता है। इंट्राडे ऑर्डर क्या है? इंट्राडे ऑर्डर का अर्थ है उसी दिन स्थिति से बाहर निकलने के इरादे से सुरक्षा खरीदना/बेचना। आप दिन के भीतर जब चाहें तब पद से बाहर निकल सकते हैं। यदि खुला छोड़ दिया जाए तो सभी इंट्राडे ऑर्डर स्वचालित रूप से चुकता हो जाते हैं। एएमओ ऑर्डर क्या है? एएमओ ऑर्डर वे ऑर्डर हैं जो बाजार बंद होने के बाद दिए जाते हैं। उन्हें नियमित ऑर्डर के समान ही रखा जा सकता है। इन ऑर्डरों को अगले कारोबारी दिन एक्सचेंज करने के लिए भेज दिया जाता है। सीमा आदेश क्या है? लिमिट ऑर्डर एक विशिष्ट मूल्य पर स्टॉक खरीदने या बेचने का ऑर्डर है। ये आदेश एक दिन के लिए वैध हैं। यदि दिन के भीतर कीमत नहीं मिलती है, तो ये ऑर्डर स्वचालित रूप से रद्द कर दिए जाते हैं। मार्केट ऑर्डर क्या है? मार्केट ऑर्डर एक खरीद या बिक्री ऑर्डर है जिसे अगले मूल्य मिलान पर तुरंत निष्पादित किया जाना है। इन ऑर्डरों का उपयोग तब किया जाता है जब आप यथाशीघ्र वांछित मात्रा खरीदना/बेचना चाहते हैं। कॉल एवं ट्रेड सुविधा क्या है? क्या इस सुविधा के लिए कोई शुल्क है? कॉल और ट्रेड सुविधा आपको एंजेल वन को कॉल करके व्यापार करने की अनुमति देती है। कॉल ट्रेड के लिए शुल्क प्रति निष्पादित ऑर्डर 20 रुपये+जीएसटी (23.60 रुपये) है। Still need help?

अपर्याप्त मार्जिन, ऑर्डर प्रकार का गलत उपयोग, ट्रेडिंग के लिए स्टॉक उपलब्ध न होना आदि सहित कई कारणों से ऑर्डर अस्वीकार किए जा सकते हैं। अपना ऑर्डर अस्वीकृति कारण जानने के लिए ऑर्डर टैब के अंतर्गत ऑर्डर इतिहास पर टैप करें 'सदस्य को इस स्क्रिप्ट में ऑर्डर देने की अनुमति नहीं है' संदेश के साथ मेरा ऑर्डर क्यों अस्वीकार कर दिया गया? इस संदेश का अर्थ है कि चयनित स्टॉक को व्यापार करने से प्रतिबंधित कर दिया गया है। यह क्यों कहता है \"नई स्थिति की अनुमति नहीं है?\" ऐसा तब होता है जब आप कम मात्रा (इलिक्विड) अनुबंधों पर ऑर्डर देते हैं जो या तो लंबी अवधि या दूर महीने के अनुबंध होते हैं। इन पदों पर व्यापार की अनुमति नहीं है। यदि स्टॉक आज स्क्वायर-ऑफ़ में है तो मेरा ऑर्डर अस्वीकार कर दिया जाए तो क्या करें? यदि चयनित स्टॉक आज स्क्वायर-ऑफ़ में है, तो आप उस शेयर में व्यापार नहीं कर पाएंगे। स्क्वायर ऑफ पूरा होने के बाद आपको बेचने/व्यापार करने की अनुमति दी जाएगी। यदि अपर्याप्त धनराशि के कारण मेरा ऑर्डर अस्वीकार कर दिया गया तो मुझे क्या करना चाहिए? यदि आपके पास व्यापार के लिए मार्जिन उपलब्ध नहीं है तो आपका ऑर्डर अस्वीकृत कर दिया जाएगा। आप या तो धनराशि जोड़ सकते हैं या ऑर्डर की मात्रा घटा सकते हैं। आप अपने शेयर गिरवी रखकर भी मार्जिन बढ़ा सकते हैं। मार्जिन कमी/सीमा मुद्दा क्या है? मार्जिन की कमी तब होती है जब आप पर्याप्त मार्जिन के बिना अपने ट्रेडिंग खाते में पोजीशन बनाए रखते हैं। कृपया सुनिश्चित करें कि मार्जिन कमी के जुर्माने से बचने के लिए आपके पास पर्याप्त बैलेंस है। मैं सेंसेक्स F&O में व्यापार क्यों नहीं कर पा रहा हूँ?

ASM और GSM सूचियाँ समय-समय पर बदलती रहती हैं। आप नीचे दी गई तालिका से वर्तमान प्रतिभूतियों की सूची देख या डाउनलोड कर सकते हैं। अदला-बदली वर्ग एनएसई एएसएम स्टॉक्स एनएसई जीएसएम स्टॉक बीएसई एएसएम स्टॉक्स बीएसई जीएसएम स्टॉक क्या एंजेल वन एएसएम और जीएसएम के तहत शेयरों की खरीद और बिक्री की अनुमति देता है? हां, हम कुछ नियमों और विनियमों के कारण एएसएम और जीएसएम के तहत स्क्रिप खरीदने और बेचने की अनुमति देते हैं। एंजेल में, एएसएम शेयरों में ट्रेडिंग की अनुमति है, जबकि जीएसएम के मामले में, केवल 0 और 1 के तहत वर्गीकृत शेयरों को व्यापार की अनुमति है। किसी विशेष शेयर या शेयर को व्यापार करने से क्यों रोका जाता है? ग्राहकों को कीमत और अस्थिरता की निगरानी के कारण होने वाले अनुचित नुकसान से बचाने के लिए और अंदरूनी व्यापार, फर्जी लेनदेन और अधिक जैसी भ्रामक गतिविधियों का पता लगाने के लिए, विशेष स्क्रिप और स्क्रिप को व्यापार करने से रोक दिया जाता है। ASM/GSM स्क्रिप के लिए कितना मार्जिन लिया जाता है? एएसएम/जीएसएम स्क्रिप के लिए ऑर्डर देते समय लागू मार्जिन सभी चरणों में 100% होगा, जबकि मूल्य बैंड में उतार-चढ़ाव होता है। जीएसएम के लिए: चरण 1 में, लागू मार्जिन 100% होगा, जबकि, चरण 2 से आगे, जीएसएम चरण के आधार पर 50% या 100% की अतिरिक्त निगरानी जमा लागू होगी। ध्यान दें: कृपया जान लें कि ग्राहक ऐसे स्टॉक नहीं खरीद पाएंगे जो जीएसएम के चरण 2 या उससे अधिक में हैं। इन शेयरों को व्यापार मूल्य के 100% या उससे अधिक की अतिरिक्त निगरानी जमा (एएसडी) की आवश्यकता होगी और स्टॉक ठोस होने के बाद भी यह मार्जिन एक्सचेंज द्वारा कम से कम 2 महीने तक अवरुद्ध रहेगा। क्या मैं अवांछित के रूप में वर्गीकृत शेयरों में व्यापार कर सकता हूँ? नहीं, एंजेल वन में अवांछित शेयरों में व्यापार प्रतिबंधित है। यहाँ क्लिक करें अधिक अनचाही निवेश युक्तियाँ जानने के लिए। दिवाला और दिवालियापन संहिता (आईबीसी) और इंटर क्रेडिटर एग्रीमेंट (आईसीए) क्या हैं? क्या होता है जब कोई स्टॉक इनमें से किसी भी कोड की निगरानी में होता है? दिवाला दिवालियापन संहिता (आईबीसी): यह कानून दिवालियापन और दिवालियेपन के मामलों को संभालने के लिए बनाया गया है। जब कोई स्टॉक IBC की निगरानी में होता है, तो इसका मतलब है कि कंपनी दिवालिया प्रक्रिया से गुजर रही है। इनमें से कुछ शेयरों के लिए, निगरानी के चरण के अधीन व्यापार की अनुमति अभी भी दी जा सकती है। अंतर ऋणदाता समझौता (आईसीए): विभिन्न उधारदाताओं और एकल उधारकर्ता के बीच एक समझौता जो डिफ़ॉल्ट के मामले में उनके अधिकारों और दायित्वों का वर्णन करता है, आईसीए है। जब कोई कंपनी कर्ज के पुनर्गठन के लिए आईसीए में प्रवेश करती है तो उसका स्टॉक निगरानी के दायरे में आ जाता है। इन मामलों में, स्टॉक में व्यापार की अनुमति दी जा सकती है लेकिन कुछ प्रतिबंधों के साथ। कुछ शेयरों को ऑप्शंस में कारोबार करने से क्यों रोका गया है? ग्राहकों को लिक्विड काउंटरों के कारण होने वाले अनुचित नुकसान से बचाने के लिए कुछ स्क्रिपों के लिए ट्रेडिंग प्रतिबंधित है। मैं एसएमई शेयर खरीदने/बेचने में असमर्थ क्यों हूँ? यदि ग्राहक ने आईपीओ के माध्यम से एसएमई शेयर खरीदे हैं, तो बेचने की अनुमति है। हालाँकि, ग्राहकों को तरल काउंटरों के कारण होने वाले अनुचित नुकसान से बचाने के लिए जोखिम और प्रबंधन निर्णय के अनुसार खरीदारी पूरी तरह से अवरुद्ध है। मुझे सीमित मात्रा में खरीदने/बेचने की अनुमति क्यों है? अतरल काउंटरों और शुष्क मात्रा के कारण खरीद/बिक्री एक विशेष मात्रा तक सीमित है। यह प्रतिबंध ग्राहकों को अतिरिक्त नुकसान से भी बचाता है। कुछ शेयरों को एक वित्तीय वर्ष में केवल 2 बार व्यापार करने की अनुमति क्यों है? यह मानदंड एंजेल वन से हटा दिया गया है। Still need help?
